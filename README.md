## What does "Discarding" a tab mean?
> A discarded tab is one whose content has been unloaded from memory, but is still visible in the tab strip.
> Its content is automatically reloaded the next time it is activated.

Discarding a tab does NOT close or remove or delete the tab.
It natively tells your browser it can free up memory and resources, and is the preferred way to keep your browser running fast and efficient.

## What about "Suspending" tabs?
Tab suspending is the old-school approach at saving memory, **but allows for visual customization**.
Your browser will still assign some resources to the suspended "mini-pages" to allow for the customization.
You can also Discard a Suspended tab...  perhaps getting the best of both worlds.
